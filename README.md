  ## Description
This is a personal project built with MERN stack and Vite.js. This app uses OpenAI's Dall-E image generating API to create and share images created by artificial intelligence. Important technologies included in the project include; TailwindCSS for styling, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Cloudinary was used for image hosting while Render and Hostinger were used for the application's deployment and hosting. User's are able to generate an image based on a prompt of their choosing or a random suggestion by clicking the surprise me button. They can then share their image to the home-page, which displays the attributed creator's name and the prompt used. Once shared, the image can be downloaded. Try it out!
